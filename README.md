# Password-Checker

Hello Everyone, this is another one of my projects dedicated to cybersecurity/Ethical Hacking, in this project i have created a custom password checker using python programming language, in which it determines the strength of the user's password and also goes as far on helping how to change it. The source code file along with the raw code both have been uploaded in this same repository for ease.

Some General Points:
1) Make sure you have vscode installed (Although it might work on other IDE's as well anyways i haven't tested it)
2) Make sure you have the latest version of the python complier installed on your system, you can use the link below to download the latest python compiler on your system.
3) Make sure you have a proper working and updated command line (Powershell or command prompt) available on your system.
